# gnl
This program reads from a file (or stdin) line by line and prints to the screen. It will return 1 when a line has been successfully read, 0 if the end of file has been reached, and -1 if there was an error.

Global variables were not allowed for this project. The only functions allowed were read, malloc, and free. Buffer size is defined during compilation and can be set to any number from 0 to INT_MAX.

Standard library functions were recoded and modified for this project.
